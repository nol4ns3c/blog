Sometimes I drink coffee and write.  
Sometimes I hack, play, make music, discover the world—and sleep.

In a world of freedom,  
**why should I limit myself to one persona?**

Once, a wise man said:  
> *"Don’t stick to anything, so you’ll have utmost freedom."*

And in *Heat*, someone said:  
> *"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner."*

That one stuck with me.

I don’t belong anywhere—  
but somehow, I belong everywhere.

In a world obsessed with **fitting in**,  
I decided to sit in my corner.

Maybe someday I’ll stand out.  
Maybe not.
