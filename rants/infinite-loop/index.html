What does a train have to do with life? I imagine a train—not just any train, but one that moves in a perfect loop. A train with no first station, no final destination. It just keeps circling the city, endlessly. You step on somewhere—anywhere—but the exact point doesn’t really matter.

<p>It’s past midnight, and I’m sitting on a train, watching the city slip by in flickering lights and blurred reflections.</p>
<p>I let my mind wander.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="what-does-a-train-have-to-do-with-life">What does a train have to do with life?<a href="#what-does-a-train-have-to-do-with-life" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h3>
<p>I imagine a train—not just any train, but one that moves in a perfect loop. A train with no first station, no final destination. It just keeps circling the city, endlessly. You step on somewhere—anywhere—but the exact point doesn’t really matter.</p>
<p>As I sit here, I watch people board and leave at different stops.<br>
They come in, take a seat, stand by the doors. Some glance at their phones, some stare out the window, lost in thought. Then, eventually, they step off, disappearing into the night.</p>
<p>And isn’t that just like life?</p>
<p>People enter your life. They share a moment, a day, maybe years.<br>
Then, one day, they leave. You don’t always know when or why.<br>
They just step off at their station, and the train moves on.</p>
<hr>
<p>But here’s the thing—when you board a train, you rarely know when you’ll get off.<br>
You just ride until it feels right. Until you’ve reached where you need to be.</p>
<p>Some people try to change the train while they’re on it.<br>
They adjust the seats, improve the air circulation, make small changes.<br>
Others do nothing. They just ride until it’s time to leave.</p>
<p>Some are lucky enough to find a seat right away—they arrived at the right time.<br>
They claim they worked hard for it, that they knew how to find it.</p>
<p>Others board when the train is full.<br>
They’re left standing, unless someone offers them a seat.<br>
Most passengers just stand, squeezed between strangers, moving with the rhythm of the train.</p>
<hr>
<p>But does it really matter?</p>
<ul>
<li>Does it matter if you sit or stand when, in the end, you leave the train anyway?</li>
<li>Does it matter if you live as a rich man or die with nothing?</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the journey, aren’t we all stepping off without taking anything with us?</p>
<p>Maybe.<br>
Maybe not.</p>
<p>Because once they step off, the train keeps moving.<br>
And soon, their presence is just a memory—<br>
Sometimes forgotten,<br>
Sometimes lingering in the echoes of the journey.</p>
<p>The train moves forward, but not really—it’s just going in circles.</p>
<p>It has no start. No end. Just like the universe. Just like time.<br>
The further you ride, eventually you come back to the same place.<br>
It was always there. Just one big loop.<br>
It’s going so fast, you don’t even realize how time passed—<br>
how people changed, departed, and entered.</p>
<hr>
<p>It reminds me of a book I read: <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>.<br>
In a hundred years, everything repeats.<br>
The people. Their passions. Their mistakes.</p>
<p>That’s the beauty of history.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I thought history was just the past—<br>
something over, not worth learning.<br>
Until I realized: <strong>history is the mirror of the future.</strong></p>
<p>Sure, technology is advancing. Governments are changing.<br>
There are no more kings or slaves—at least by name.</p>
<p>Wait. You think there aren’t?</p>
<p>What about people who work all day just to earn a bite of bread?<br>
While others live the best life, untouched?</p>
<p>We change the names of things.<br>
But we follow the same trajectory.<br>
Making the same mistakes.</p>
<p>Just like a loop.</p>
<hr>
<p>Some people keep looking back at the stations they’ve passed.<br>
They miss the old stops. They live in the past.<br>
But it brings nothing but sorrow.</p>
<p>Others are worried about where they’re going.<br>
They cling to the idea of a better future.<br>
<strong>Hope keeps them on the track.</strong></p>
<p>But how many of us are truly living in the moment?</p>
<p>How many stop to appreciate the now?<br>
The trees, the mountains, the lakes.<br>
The quiet things we rarely notice or appreciate.</p>
<p>Our constant thoughts cloud the beauty around us—<br>
Regret, missed opportunities, anxiety about a future we’re not even sure we’ll reach.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are so hopeful we’ll make it to the next station.</p>
<p>But maybe that hope is what keeps us alive.</p>
<p>No one stays on the train forever.</p>
<p>Even I will have to leave one day.</p>
<p>Maybe not today.<br>
Maybe not tomorrow.<br>
But someday, the doors will open, and I will know—<strong>it’s time.</strong></p>
<p>And when I do, the train will keep moving.</p>
<p>New people will take my seat.<br>
I’ll live in some memories. But not for long.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>True death comes when you vanish from the memory of the last person who knew you.<br>
And maybe that’s the best we can hope for.</p></blockquote>
<p>The worst?<br>
To go unknown while you’re still alive.<br>
To live in the dark corners of the train.<br>
To never even glance at the light—nor try to.</p>
<p>Some people leave a brief but vivid mark.<br>
Others are already dead in spirit, their presence no longer felt.</p>
<hr>
<p>But the city will remain.<br>
The lights will keep flickering.</p>
<p>And the loop will go on.</p>
<hr>
<p>But maybe—just maybe—<br>
<strong>I’ll hop on again.</strong><br>
In another time, in another way.</p>
<p>Until then,<br>
<strong>I ride.</strong></p>
